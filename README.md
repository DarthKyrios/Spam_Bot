# This is a Pre-alpha version, just intended to be used  #
# as a quick spaming/trolling tool solution for the      #

CLAIMS
--------------------
- This code is not bad intentioned, but the ones who use it for their evil purposes. 
- Feel free to use it, edit it and rebuild it as you wish
- Do not expect it to be perfect, but rather intuitive and functional
- Regular crashes with unexpected integers are to be expected. Just use common sense

# HOW TO USE #
##############

#### FIRST WINDOW

- Message Delay -> This refers to the time (in seconds) that it will take for a message to be resent
- Switching Sets Delay -> This refers to the time (in seconds) that it will take for a Set of messages to restart 

This two options are meant to avoid any sort of "anti spaming" locking measure by using refreshing periods of time. 

- Sets Range -> It stablishes the number of responses that will be sent as a group. 

The values shown are by default. 

#### SPAM BOT - PRE ALPHA 1.0

- Message To Spam -> Write the message you would like to Spam
- Number of Sets -> The number of Sets you want to be sent
- Seconds to execute -> The time it will take the program to start running. This is meant for you to have enough reaction time to choose the target app. 

Now before the time you selected ends, you have to click wherever you want your message to be written and do not do anything else with the computer. The program will start to spam your message and will also display some information about the process.
